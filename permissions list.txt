Permissions list
The following permissions are available:

-A, --allow-all Allow all permissions. This disables all security.
--allow-env Allow environment access for things like getting and setting of environment variables.
--allow-hrtime Allow high resolution time measurement. High resolution time can be used in timing attacks and fingerprinting.
--allow-net=\<allow-net> Allow network access. You can specify an optional, comma separated list of domains to provide a whitelist of allowed domains.
--allow-plugin Allow loading plugins. Please note that --allow-plugin is an unstable feature.
--allow-read=\<allow-read> Allow file system read access. You can specify an optional, comma separated list of directories or files to provide a whitelist of allowed file system access.
--allow-run Allow running subprocesses. Be aware that subprocesses are not run in a sandbox and therefore do not have the same security restrictions as the deno process. Therefore, use with caution.
--allow-write=\<allow-write> Allow file system write access. You can specify an optional, comma separated list of directories or files to provide a whitelist of allowed file system access.
